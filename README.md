3 Files : MyKNN.java MyKnnModel.java algorithm.xml

MyKNN.Java :    FUNCTION:  Plugin for BioCat interface.  Performs the K
              Nearest Neighbor Algorithm, on image data.  Data
              may be extracted or selected by various methods before.
              Trains a model, and clssifies test cases based on that.
              

MyKnnModel.java : FUNCTION:  Contains the MyKnnModel class.
                Class stores the data as well as paramaters
                K number of neihgbors, P number of attributes
  
algorithm.xml   : FUNCTION:  Contains xml to display algorithm name
                and select paramters on the BioCat interface
